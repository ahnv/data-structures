# Programs

### Program 1
```Let assume an array A of size n. Perform an exchange such that ‘A[j]’ becomes ‘i’ if ‘A[i]’ is ‘j’```

### Program 2
``` Given a singly linked list, swap every 2 nodes, for odd number of input; retain the last node as it is.```
> Eg: 
> Input: 5 13 15 18 20 11 6 7
> Output: 13 5 18 15 11 20 7 6

### Program 3
```Find the Maximum and Minimum of an array using minimum number of comparisons.```

### Program 4
```Take two array dynamically and find out whether an array is subset of another array or not and also find which one is the subset.```

### Program 5
```Assume that an array and one sum is given to you. Find whether a pair exists in the array that sums equal to given sum or not.```

### Program 6
```Calculate the frequency of the numbers in a given Linked List.```

### Program 7
```Reverse the linked list by changing the link of the nodes only.```

### Program 8
```Remove the duplicate elements exits in linked list.```

### Program 9
```There are two linked lists. Perform the addition and store in the third linked list.```

### Program 10
```Reverse last 5 nodes of linked list.```
> E.g.
> Input: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7
> Output: 1,2,7,6,5,4,3
